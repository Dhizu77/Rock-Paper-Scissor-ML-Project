# Rock Paper Scissors Classification Project

This project is developed as a requirement for the completion of the DBS Foundation Bootcamp, specifically focusing on machine learning. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of classifying images of hand gestures representing "rock," "paper," and "scissors."

## Project Overview

The Rock Paper Scissors Classification Project aims to provide a practical demonstration of applying machine learning techniques to image classification tasks. This project involves data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The primary objective is to create a robust and accurate model that can classify hand gestures into one of the three categories: rock, paper, or scissors.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and libraries are utilized in this project:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application used to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework used for building and training the neural network model.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow (included within TensorFlow).
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations in Python.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **OS**: A standard library in Python used for interacting with the operating system (used for file handling).

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Directory containing the Jupyter Notebook used for experimentation and development.
- `README.md`: The main documentation file for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the dependencies and libraries required to run the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors-classification.git
   cd rock-paper-scissors-classification
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Rock_Paper_Scissor_Update_2.ipynb
   ```

## Data Collection

The dataset used for this project consists of images of hand gestures representing rock, paper, and scissors. The images are collected from various sources and are labeled accordingly. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure proper evaluation of the model.

## Model Training

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of several convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers. The model is trained using the training dataset, and hyperparameters are tuned to optimize performance. Various techniques, such as data augmentation and dropout, are employed to enhance the model's generalization ability.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model. The results are visualized using confusion matrices and classification reports.

## Conclusion

The Rock Paper Scissors Classification Project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to image classification tasks. The project showcases the end-to-end workflow, from data collection to model evaluation, providing valuable insights into the practical aspects of machine learning.
